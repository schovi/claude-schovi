## Writing Guidelines

### Be Specific
❌ "The validation is broken"
✅ "Field validation in `FieldValidator.ts:67` rejects valid email addresses with '+' characters"

### Quantify Impact
❌ "This affects many users"
✅ "This affects ~500 users daily (15% of active users) who cannot save their settings"

### Provide Evidence
❌ "The code is slow"
✅ "API response time is 2.3s (p95) vs target 200ms, traced to N+1 query in `UserService.ts:123`"

### Use File References
❌ "Update the controller"
✅ "Update `api/controllers/MappingController.ts:123`"

### Make Trade-offs Clear
❌ "Option 1 is better"
✅ "Option 1 is faster to implement (2 days vs 1 week) but increases technical debt vs Option 2's cleaner architecture"

### Be Actionable
❌ "Consider performance"
✅ "Add Redis caching layer in `CacheService.ts` to reduce database queries by ~80%"

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach, blocking all users
- **High**: Major functionality broken, blocking many users, significant revenue impact
- **Medium**: Feature degraded, workaround exists, affecting subset of users
- **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic problem, low user impact

---

## Problem Types

- **bug**: Existing functionality not working as intended
- **feature**: New capability to build
- **investigation**: Unclear problem needing exploration
- **performance**: Speed, efficiency, or resource usage issue
- **refactor**: Code quality/architecture improvement

## Usage

This template is referenced by:
- `/schovi:analyze-problem` command
- `analysis-generator` subagent

When generating analyses, the subagent reads this structure and fills in sections based on exploration results and problem context.
